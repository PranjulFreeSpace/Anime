MaidoDism Maid Tournament – Stage 1 Planning Document


---

1. Introduction

Stage 1 of the MaidoDism Tournament begins with 5,000 maid participants.  This phase uses a token-based elimination system and a separate performance-based scoring system to filter competitors.  Note: The process of forming the initial pool of Bud maids (e.g., grouping 2,500 Bud maids) occurs before Stage 1 and is not covered here.


---

2. Participants

Total Competitors: 5,000 selected maids.

Eligibility: Bud‑class and above (Bud selection mechanism is external to Stage 1).

Dynamic Entries: If participant count isn’t exactly 5,000, filler characters may be summoned to balance the bracket.

3. Core Systems

3.1 Tokens (Elimination Currency)

Starting Balance: Each player begins with 5 tokens.

Stakes per Match: In every match, the loser transfers 1 token to the winner.

Elimination: Reaching 0 tokens results in immediate elimination.

Token Cap: A maximum of 25 tokens can be held by any player; any surplus beyond 25 is disallowed.

Qualification Threshold: At the Stage 1 deadline, any player holding 25 tokens qualifies for Stage 2.


3.2 Score (Performance Metric)

Win: +10 points

Loss: −5 points

Role: Tracks individual performance for seeding and special awards but does not directly affect elimination.

4. Matchmaking & Challenges

1. Open Challenges: Any two players may issue or accept a challenge via the official tournament app.


2. Match Types: 1v1 or team-based (equal team sizes), in any agreed game (sports, video/end‑to‑end, puzzles, etc.).


3. Negotiation: Both parties must agree on game rules, format, and conditions prior to play.


4. Completion Requirement: Once accepted, a match must be completed and logged.

5. Participation & Fairness Rules

5.1 Daily Participation Mandate

Minimum: At least 1 match every 24 hours.

Penalty: Failure to do so means loss of the right to refuse challenges for the next 24 hours; any unplayed matches in that period count as losses.


5.2 Challenge Refusal

Players may refuse any challenge unless they have triggered the inactivity penalty.


5.3 Anti-Exploitation Measures

Match-Fixing Detection: App-based pattern analysis flags suspicious reciprocal wins/losses.

Farm-Proofing: Losses cost score and tokens; repeated easy wins against weak opponents offer diminishing returns.

Token Donation Limits: While voluntary gift of tokens is permitted, large transfers are monitored and reviewed.



---

6. Event Infrastructure

Tournament App: Central hub for challenges, scheduling, results, token & score tracking, and organizer notifications.

Venues: Physical or virtual arenas provided on demand; resources are effectively unlimited.

Refereeing: Automated logging plus on‑site marshals ensure compliance and resolve disputes.



---

7. Rewards & Incentives

Stage 2 Qualification: Hold 25 tokens at deadline.

High-Score Recognition: Players with top scores earn seeding advantages and bonus in Stage 2.

Participation Rewards: Minor titles or items awarded for consistent engagement, even if eliminated.



---

8. Stage 1 Structure & Timeline

Duration: 30 days from kickoff.

Progress Tracking: Daily leaderboard updates for tokens and scores.

Elimination Flow: As tokens reach zero, participants drop out; as tokens approach 25, they secure qualification.
